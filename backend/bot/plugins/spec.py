"""Public contract for application plugins.

Plugins are separate Python packages that extend the application without
forking it. A package advertises itself through the ``minishop.plugins``
entry point group; the entry point must resolve to a :class:`Plugin`
subclass or instance.

Every hook is optional: the base class provides no-op defaults, so a plugin
only overrides what it needs. Hooks must not assume a particular call order
beyond the guarantees documented on each method.

The plugin API is experimental and may change between minor versions.
